### Firmware

There are two boards within the Control Hub: an Expansion Hub ****and an Android controller. The Expansion Hub board built into the Control Hub, facilitates a line of communication between the built in Robot Controller and the motors, servos, and sensors. In order to improve the quality of the Hubs, REV Robotics will release firmware updates for the Expansion Hub. When a firmware release occurs, both Control Hub and Expansion Hub users will need to update their Expansion Hub firmware to the newest version. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to use the REV Hardware Client for firmware updates, the Robot Controller Application must first be updated to version 5.5. After updating the application you may need to close out of the REV Hardware Client in order for the firmware update to be available.
