# Core Hex Motor

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/core hex motor.png>)

## Overview

The Core Hex Motor is a motor that features a 90 degree orientation and a female output shaft for greater flexibility and ease of use. The 'horizontal' orientation allows it to be located in positions that the other motors cannot be placed in.&#x20;

### Limitations:

While it may be more versatile than the HD Hex Motor kits ([40:1](40-1-spur-gearbox-with-hd-hex-motor.md), 20:1, and [UltraPlanetary](ultraplanetary-hd-gearing-with-hd-hex-motor.md)), there are no internal capabilities for gear reductions.&#x20;

| Pros                                            | Cons                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Versatile                                       | No possibility of gear adjustments internally                                    |
| Decent torque                                   | Not great speed                                                                  |
| Ability to have axle protrude through the motor | Ability to have axle protrude through the motor (mounting can be more difficult) |

### Code:

The code for the Core Hex Motor is not difficult at all. It follows the same standard structure as all the other DC motors.&#x20;
