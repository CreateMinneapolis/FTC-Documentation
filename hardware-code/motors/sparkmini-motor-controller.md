# SPARKmini Motor Controller

FTC teams can add a SPARKmini Motor Controller to utilize more than four DC motors from a single Hub. This increases your potential DC motor count to five per hub.&#x20;

The motor controller takes power in (using the same power source as the control hubs themselves) and a servo connector to control a DC motor.&#x20;

As of 7/22/2022, each controller costs $35. [https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1230/](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-31-1230/)
