# UltraPlanetary HD Gearing (with Hex Motor)

### Explanation

UltraPlanetary gearing allows motor to immediately feed into gearing in a compact manner. When attached, UltraPlanetary gears grant greater torque at the expense of rotational speed. For example, if a 5:1 gear is placed in the motor assembly, the shaft will only rotate once for every five rotations of the motor. The motor will be 1/5 as fast, but have 5x the torque (think of it as 5x as strong).

Often, multiple gears will be placed on top of each other in the assembly to multiply the torque factor. For example, if one placed a 5:1 on the motor, then a 3:1 on the 5:1, the overall ratio would be 15:1. The motor will go 1/15th the speed, but will be 15x stronger.

#### Example Uses

* Drivetrain motors (5:1)
* Arm extension motors (20:1 or more)
