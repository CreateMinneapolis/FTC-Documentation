# Connecting a Driver Hub

## Connect the Battery

Before we connect to your Driver Hub we need to make sure the internal battery is installed correctly. 

#### Battery Installation

To install the battery, place it with the REV Logo out and the -/+ located near the contacts for the device. Add on the rear door and screw in using the included M3 hardware.
